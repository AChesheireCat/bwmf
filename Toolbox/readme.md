BW shared toolbox to contain scripts, loadouts, templates, etc. in a distributed version control environment. BW MMs can improve on scripts, loadouts, etc. without having to download the most recent version, update it, re-upload, etc.



Examples: Loadouts worth sharing but not worth adding to the framework Scripts like `argo_fnc_setId`, `diw_acre_fnc_createRadioJammer` Templates for images like intel documents and map boards.
